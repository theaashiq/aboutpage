<h3>Frontend</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications.
                              The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, 
							  while back-end refers to how it works. You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.
                              The basic languages for Front-End Development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
